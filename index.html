    <title>Finance & Accounting Interview Prep</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a multi-level flashcard system. The structure features a nested sidebar that allows users to navigate through main categories and their sub-categories. This was chosen to handle the large dataset, enabling a highly organized and focused study flow. A user selects a sub-category in the sidebar, which then populates the main content area with all relevant questions. This provides a clear, hierarchical path for exploration, moving from broad topics to specific concepts, which is ideal for systematic learning and exam preparation. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Content (questions and answers) is presented using interactive cards, with each card representing a single topic. Report Info: Hierarchical topics -> Goal: Structured learning and recall -> Presentation Method: Nested sidebar for navigation, interactive click-to-reveal cards, and a search bar -> Interaction: Sidebar sections expand/collapse, cards toggle answer visibility, filtering by sub-category, and marking as "mastered" or "important", with the ability to add new concepts dynamically -> Justification: This structure avoids overwhelming the user with all questions at once, provides a clear learning path, and allows users to master one sub-topic before moving to the next. The search and "Show Important" functions provide alternative, quick ways to find information. The new "Add Concept" feature makes the guide extensible and personalized. The new rich-text editing feature allows users to customize content with persistent local storage. -> Library/Method: Vanilla JavaScript, Tailwind CSS. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

        const interviewData = [
            { id: 1, category: 'Accounting Fundamentals', subCategory: 'Basic Principles of Accounting', question: 'Explain the Accounting Equation and its significance.', answer: 'The accounting equation is Assets = Liabilities + Equity. It represents the relationship between a company\'s assets and the claims on those assets. Assets are financed either by borrowing (liabilities) or by the owners (equity). It is the fundamental principle of the double-entry system, ensuring that a company\'s balance sheet is always in balance.' },
            { id: 2, category: 'Accounting Fundamentals', subCategory: 'Basic Principles of Accounting', question: 'Differentiate between Accrual and Cash Basis accounting.', answer: 'Accrual basis: Revenue is recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred, regardless of when cash is exchanged. This method provides a more accurate picture of a company\'s profitability. Cash basis: Revenue is recognized when cash is received and expenses are recognized when cash is paid out. This method is simpler but may not reflect actual financial performance for a period.' },
            { id: 3, category: 'Accounting Fundamentals', subCategory: 'Basic Principles of Accounting', question: 'What is the Matching Concept?', answer: 'The matching concept dictates that expenses should be recognized in the same period as the revenues they helped generate. For example, the cost of goods sold should be matched with the revenue from those sales in the same accounting period.' },
            { id: 4, category: 'Accounting Fundamentals', subCategory: 'Basic Principles of Accounting', question: 'Explain the Prudence/Conservatism concept.', answer: 'The prudence principle requires that when faced with uncertainty, an accountant should recognize all losses and expenses as soon as they are probable, but should only recognize revenues and gains when they are certain. This prevents overstating profits and assets.' },
            { id: 5, category: 'Accounting Fundamentals', subCategory: 'Basic Principles of Accounting', question: 'What is Materiality & Relevance?', answer: 'Materiality: Information is material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users. Relevance: Information is relevant if it has the capacity to influence a user\'s decision. These concepts help accountants decide which information should be disclosed and which can be omitted.' },
            { id: 6, category: 'Accounting Fundamentals', subCategory: 'Basic Principles of Accounting', question: 'Explain the Going Concern Assumption.', answer: 'The going concern assumption assumes that a business will continue to operate for the foreseeable future. This assumption is foundational because it allows assets to be valued at their original cost (less depreciation) rather than their liquidation value.' },
            { id: 7, category: 'Accounting Fundamentals', subCategory: 'Basic Principles of Accounting', question: 'What is the Consistency Principle?', answer: 'The consistency principle states that a company should use the same accounting policies and methods from one period to the next. This ensures that financial statements are comparable over time.' },
            { id: 8, category: 'Accounting Fundamentals', subCategory: 'Basic Principles of Accounting', question: 'Explain Substance over Form.', answer: 'The substance over form principle states that accountants should record the economic reality of a transaction rather than its legal form. For example, a finance lease that is legally a rental agreement is treated as a purchase because the economic substance is that the lessee has acquired the asset.' },
            { id: 9, category: 'Accounting Fundamentals', subCategory: 'Basic Principles of Accounting', question: 'What are Revenue Recognition Principles?', answer: 'Revenue is recognized when it is earned, not necessarily when cash is received. The key principles include: (1) an exchange has occurred, (2) the earnings process is complete, and (3) collectibility is reasonably assured.' },
            { id: 10, category: 'Accounting Fundamentals', subCategory: 'Accounting Standards', question: 'Briefly describe Ind AS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements.', answer: 'Ind AS 1 sets out the overall requirements for the presentation of financial statements, including guidance on structure, content, and minimum disclosure requirements. It ensures comparability with the entity\'s own prior period financial statements and with the financial statements of other entities.' },
            { id: 11, category: 'Accounting Fundamentals', subCategory: 'Accounting Standards', question: 'What does Ind AS 16 cover?', answer: 'Ind AS 16 deals with the accounting for Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E). It covers the recognition, measurement, and depreciation of such assets, including the capitalization of costs and subsequent revaluations.' },
            { id: 12, category: 'Accounting Fundamentals', subCategory: 'Accounting Standards', question: 'Explain the core of Ind AS 12: Income Taxes.', answer: 'Ind AS 12 prescribes the accounting treatment for income taxes. It focuses on how to account for the current and future tax consequences of past transactions or events.
